##Version 0.1: Lexer Implemented

This file can be run just by executing the main method in Lexer.java. It directly references
a file path hardcoded to be the test file for now. The currently coded test file is a test file
generated by a tool made by Jacob Schwartz. I included a handwritten testfile if it is not
acceptable to use a randomly generated test file if that test file was generated by a tool I
did not create.

###Changes:
>Implemented Lexer with handling for Keywords, Identifiers, Numbers, and Symbols.

>Checks for valid characters; 
 valid construction of comments, constants, and identifiers; 
 ensures whitespace surrounding identifiers;
 checks if constant or identifier exceeds max allowed length; 
 and throws custom errors if any of these conditions are not met
 
 >Properly handles '..' and scientific notation edge cases, as well as malformed constants
 where each are interrupted with an unexpected character (e.g. 5. , 5.3e. , 5.3ea, 5.a)

 Parker: Thanks for being a very helpful coach during your hours 
 
 Jacob Schwartz: Thanks for generating a testfile 
 that is more expansive than one I could write by hand.
