##Version 0.25: Parser Implemented with Lexer fixes

To run this file:

- Pull the files from github maintaining the directory structure

- cd into src/com and javac *.java

- cd back out to src and run com.Parser

- The output corresponds to the test file located in src/com/LanguageResources/ultcorrected.txt

###Changelog:

####Version 0.25
>Implemented Parser

>Error handling that tracks down the line of the error and reports what kind of error, i.e


>Lexer bug fixes: caught edge case where some realconstant tokens where the character
after that token would be consumed and ignored

####Version 0.1
>Implemented Lexer with handling for Keywords, Identifiers, Numbers, and Symbols.

>Checks for valid characters; 
 valid construction of comments, constants, and identifiers; 
 ensures whitespace surrounding identifiers;
 checks if constant or identifier exceeds max allowed length; 
 and throws custom errors if any of these conditions are not met
 
 >Properly handles '..' and scientific notation edge cases, as well as malformed constants
 where each are interrupted with an unexpected character (e.g. 5. , 5.3e. , 5.3ea, 5.a)
 
 >Currently, this is too static. I ran out of time to rework this but I am aware and
 this will be improved upon in subsequent versions.
 
 
 ##History
 
 ###Version 0.1: Lexer Implemented
 
 To run this file: 
 
 -Place all .java files and txt test files into a directory called "com"
 
 - Compile it
 
 - Move the working directory to the directory above the com directory
  
 - Ensure test files are in the same directory as the compiled classes 
  
 - Run Lexer.class with an argument giving it the name of the test file WITH file extension.
 
 -For example use command line argument: "java com.Lexer lextexttest.txt"
 
 
 The currently coded test file is a test file generated by a tool made by Jacob Schwartz. I included a handwritten testfile if it is not
 acceptable to use a randomly generated test file if that test file was generated by a tool I
 did not create.
 
 Here are the two arguments for the test files:
 
 ./lextexttest.txt

 Parker: Thanks for being a very helpful coach during your hours 
 
 Jacob Schwartz: Thanks for generating a testfile 
 that is more expansive than one I could write by hand.
