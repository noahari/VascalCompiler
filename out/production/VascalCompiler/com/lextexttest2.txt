1.1e-5

hello my friend.
welcome to my PRoGraM


{i worked pretty hard on it}

I spent 10000e10000 hours on it

1..1..w

and it even handles malformed constants

{1.1a1 AND 1.a both throw errors, and so would this comment if it didnt close}

and so do identifiers not bounded by nonalphanumeric chars or whitespace, watch

1e+1 a1
